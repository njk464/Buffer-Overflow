For target3 we both knew what the vulnerability the hard part was finding the exact number that overflowed to exactly 2808 bytes. Nick Kantor wrote the code to find the exact overflow number and Tanner Harper debugged it as I ran the c code on my machine (64 bit) and the size of widget_t on my machine was not 56 bytes.

For Target4 Nick Kantor provided the majority of the information and wrote the sploit code for the attack.

For Target5 Tanner Harper figured out the vulnerability and wrote the sploit code.
